This repository contains the Bash Script which cleaned the RNA seq data via FastQC, removed Illumina adapters via TrimGalore, and quantified the expression of transcripts using Salmon. The R file quantified differential expression using DEseq2, and includes plots (MA and Volcano) as well as gene ontology analysis to identify the biological function of the most differentially expressed genes. THe results from all this analysis were presented in the .pptx file.
